# Jumble Sort

Write a program that takes a list of strings containing integers and words 
as standard input and returns a sorted version of that list as standard output.
  
But there's a twist!

You must sort the list in such a way that all words are in alphabetical 
order, and all integers are in numerical order, but **if the nth element of the input list is an integer it must remain an integer, and if it is a word it must remain a word**

Or if you prefer a more pseudo-codish specification

```
For all i, 0 < i < list.length
  if list[i] is INT 
    then jumblesort(list)[i] is INT
  if list[i] is STRING
    then jumblesort(list)[i] is STRING
```
 
See examples below.
  
 
Input:
------
 
The input will contain a single, possibly empty, line containing a
space-separated list of strings to be sorted. Words will not contain
spaces, will contain only the lower-case letters a-z. Integers will be
in the range -999999 to 999999, inclusive. The line will be at most 1000
characters long.
 
 
Output:
-------
 
The program must output the list of strings, sorted per the requirements
above. Strings must be separated by a single space, with no leading
space at the beginning of the line or trailing space at the end of the
line.
 
 
Constraints:
------------
 
The code you submit must take input from the command line and produce output to
`stdout` as specified above. No other output is permitted. You can
assume the input will be valid. Feel free to use standard libraries to
assist in sorting.

You may use any language you want, so long as you only use standard libraries
within that language. 

Your code will be graded with an automatic grader. Your code should be
in the form of an executable called "jumblesort" that can be executed as follows

```
$ ./jumblesort 1 alpha 2 beta
1 alpha 2 beta
```

If you code must be compiled on the grading machine to run, please include a short 
README with compilation instructions. 

NB: The person running this will be an engineer, and will use some reasonable effort
to get your code to run on the grading machine. Examples of reasonable things include
modifying the location of a local `python` interpreter, or understanding how to build
`java` files. Please try to conform to typical standards and behaviors as much as possible.
 
Example 1:
----------
Input:
 
```
./jumblesort 1
```
 
Output:
 
```
1
```
 
 
Example 2:
----------
Input:
 
```

```
bus car truck
```
 
 
Example 3:
----------

Input:
