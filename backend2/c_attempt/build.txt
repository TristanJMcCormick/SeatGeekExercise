So I don't actually know that much about compilers and I definitely don't know
much about building c programs. But I know that running
  "g++ -o datasync DataCenterScramble.c"
compiles DataCenterScramble.c and writes the output to file DataCenterScramble
and that you can then run the compiled program with ./DataCenterScramble. So,
I hope that's enough!
